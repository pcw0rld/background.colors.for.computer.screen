## Change your desktop background color

Select Start  > Settings  > Personalization > Colors, and then choose your own color, or let Windows pull an accent color from your background.

## How to change background color in Windows

* Right click on desktop and select Personalize at the bottom of the drop down menu.
* To personalize Yourtheme I recommend that you start from one of the High Contrast themes (if you start from the other themes, the background in internet browsers won’t change automatically – my favorite starting theme has been the High Contrast Black theme).
* Go to the drop down menu, called Item, which appears at the bottom of the Window Color and Appearance window
* Select the items one by one and change background and text colors for each of the items in the boxes to the right of the Item window. You can choose one of the preset colors (see below), or any color you whish by clicking on the Other… button.
* Save your new theme: click on the Unsaved Theme (top left theme in the Personalization window).Next, right click it and choose either of the options that open a dialog box where you can name your new theme.
